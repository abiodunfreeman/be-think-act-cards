               When you're worried about something today, write down 3 things about it that you can control, and 3 things you can't. 
               <br/><br/>
               For example, you can control how much you rest and hydrate when you're sick, but you can't control exactly when you'll feel better.
               <br/><br/>
               Focus your efforrts on what's in your power, and let go of fruitless mental efforts that try to force the outcome you want.

                Nothing has a bigger impact on our well-being than our connections to others.
                <br/><br/>
                Think of someone you know who brings out the best in you and who obviously values you.
                <br/><br/>
                Contact this person today, and arrange a time to get together if they live close by, or to speak by phone if they're far away.

                The best parts of our lives fade into the background and become invisible, unless they're taken from us.
                <br/><br/>
                Become more aware today of the ordinary things you're glad to have, such as the air you breate, the clothes you wear, the home that shelters you, and the people you love.
                <br/><br/>
                Acknowledge the everyday gifts that fill your life.
