        that you can control, and 3 things you can't.

        <br />
        For example, you can control how much you rest and hydrate when you're
        sick, but you can't control exactly when you'll feel better.

        Focus your efforrts on what's in your power, and let go of fruitless
        mental efforts that try to force the outcome you want.

        Contact this person today, and arrange a time to get together if they

        It's hard to let go of chronic worries, in part because our minds often
        tell us we need to worry about something and that worrying is in some
        way useful--even if we can't control the outcome.
        <br />
        <br />
        Notice if this belief is driving your worry today, and give yourself
        permission to let go of unproductive trains of thought.
